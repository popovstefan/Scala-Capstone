# Functional programming with Scala


## Capstone project work for the Functional Programming in Scala specialization at Coursera

The application processes several gygabytes of data to show interactive visualizations of the evolution of temperatures over time all over the world.
The development of such an application involved:
* Transforming data provided by weather stations into meaningful information like, the average temperature of each point of the globe over the last ten years
* Making images from this information by using spatial and linear interpolation techniques
* Implementing how the user interface will react to usersâ€™ actions
